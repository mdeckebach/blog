The day after finishing Te Araroa, I sat down to 
reflect about my gear. My goal was to share what 
worked, what didn’t, and how everything fit together. 
The editing is a bit crude (I don’t have access to 
proper software at the moment), but I hope that this 
video helps anyone planning to walk Te Araroa.
