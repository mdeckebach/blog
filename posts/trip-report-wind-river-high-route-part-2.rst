Recap
=====
Sprout and I met to tackle some unfinished business in the Wind River Range. Despite being a short stretch of ~50 miles, Section 4 did not disappoint. Here's a recap in photo format:

    *Starting up the all-too-familiar Glacier Trail on Day 1. Fortunately, it was a lot less buggy this time so I could stop for picture breaks.*

    *We camped on night 1 in a familiar forest, almost exactly the same location where we had camped on our last night a year ago.*

    *Emerging above treeline and approaching the end of the Glacier Trail. Brooding clouds threatened in the distance as we knew some weather was in the forecast.*

    *After a quick morning pace, we were back on the WHR. Stopped at these walled sites (PR-44) for a quick snack and to decide whether to continue ascending toward West Sentinal Pass or to retreat with the coming storm. We gambled and decided to push on into exposed country.*

    *Sprout ascending West Sentinal Pass.*

    *First steps on Gannett Glacier.*

    *Small (yet deep) crevasse on Gannett Glacier. I'm not sure we encountered anything large enough to swallow an adult human, but in retrospect it wouldn't have been a bad idea to rope up.*

    *Crossing the glacier with a clear view of the saddle west of 12,025 in the distance.*

    *Another shot of Sprout on Gannett Glacier.*

    *Looking back at West Sentinal Pass and Gannett Glacier (where we came from). The sky was really starting to get dark so we did not linger long.*

    *Hunkering down at PR-46, "possible camps if snow-free." Up at the headwaters of Gannett Creak, we felt very exposed. Starting late afternoon, probably the largest storm I've ever experienced began. It dumped pretty consistently for ~15 hours, with multiple rounds of hail and lightning (which I really did not love given our remoteness and exposure). The worst was the wind, which came on extra strong during the night. Around 3AM it finally ripped out a stake and broke my trekking pole. I was able to fix my shelter without much further damage. Needless to say, neither of us slept much this night.*

    *In the calm of the following morning, we continued on to Grasshopper Glacier. Pictured above is the start of the glacier.*

    *Looking down Grasshopper Glacier (we went up, not down to the valley). Despite its shrinking size, the magnitude of this ice field is hard to comprehend.*

    *After Grasshopper, we enjoyed easy cross-country travel along the crest. Pictured here is Sprout with Sourdough Glacier in the distance.*

    *We wanted Downs Mountain (the last real objective/milestone on the WRHR) bad. Here's Sprout making her way across a snow field along the crest as the miles continue to shrink.*

.. figure:: /images/writing/trip-report-wind-river-high-route-part-2/img-16.jpg

    *After a couple of false summits, we finally made it! No peak is complete without a trash selfie, so here is Sprout and I on top of Downs. Far off in the distance is Gannett Peak and the rest of the range.*

    *Pretty views while traversing No Mans Pass. After this, it was easy and gradual walking all the way back to the car.*
