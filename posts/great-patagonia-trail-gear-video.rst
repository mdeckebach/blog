It’s been almost a year since my trip on the Greater Patagonia Trail, but I finally got around to making a video showing all the gear we used during our 2017-2018 packrafting adventure. Despite my amateur video editing skills, I hope that this video brings the gear list to life and helps illustrate how a lightweight packrafting setup can fit together.

`Here is a detailed gear list with comments`_.

Special thanks to my friend Summer School for letting me use his music in the video: “Super Funk Deluxe” and “Groovy Tuesday.” His other work is awesome and you should totally check him out on Spotify_ or `Apple Music`_. Thanks Josh!
