Recently, I’ve had a couple people planning future thru-hikes ask me for more information about my Te Araroa hike, specifically how long it took and how much it cost.

Being a bit of an Excel nerd and enjoying a good number crunch, I decided to dig back through my records and create some pivot tables. I found that my hike took 101 calendar days and cost $3,085.98 USD. What follows is a detailed breakdown.

Background Statistics
=====================

I kept a daily journal of my hike in which I recorded each day’s start point, end point, and mileage hiked. Using this information, I was able to answer a number of questions.

How long did Te Araroa take?
----------------------------
I started the evening of December 6, 2016, and finished March 16, 2017. In total, Te Araroa took 101 calendar days. Breaking it down by island, my hike looked like this:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: condensed-table

    * - 
      - North Island
      - South Island
      - Full Te Araroa
    * - **Start Date**
      - 12/6/16
      - 2/3/17
      - 12/6/16
    * - **End Date**
      - 2/1/17
      - 3/16/17
      - 3/16/17
    * - **Total Days**
      - 58
      - 42
      - 101

It was roughly a 60/40 split between the north and south islands. Included in these numbers are **seven total zero days** (three on the North Island, three on the South Island, and one in between for the ferry). That means I averaged a zero day once every two weeks.

What was my hiking pace?
------------------------
My average mileage ended up being right around 18.4 mi/day:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: condensed-table

    * - North Island
      - South Island
      - Full Te Araroa
    * - 18.2 mi/day
      - 19.2 mi/day
      - 18.4 mi/day

Conventional wisdom says that people cover less distance per day on the South Island, but I experienced the opposite. Overall this deviation was small—about a mile per day. This may be due to the fact that while the North Island is easier, by the time I got to the South Island my legs were in trail shape and I had established a rhythm.


The chart above shows my daily hiking totals (the green line) along with a 10-day moving average (the dashed orange line). Some takeaways:

    - My zero days were fairly evenly spread. The only time I took a double zero was Feb 13 & 14, when I was stuck in Blue Lake Hut waiting out a terrible storm.

    - I wanted to start slow and hike conservatively until I felt like I had my legs under me, so (excluding the first full day when I was overly excited) it was reassuring to see my moving average increase steadily throughout the first month.

    - The dip in pace from 1/31 to 2/21 is indicative of the northern half of the South Island. The sections from Ship Cove to Methven were the most strenuous.

    - My longest day was 43.0 miles (69.4km). It was also my final day.


Hopefully this table provides a basic sense of pacing on the TA. As a point of comparison for those familiar with the Appalachian Trail or Pacific Crest Trail, I averaged 17.8 mi/day on the AT and 20.7 mi/day on the PCT.

How often did I pay for accommodations?
---------------------------------------
The Te Araroa definitely felt like it had less opportunities to freedom (or “wild”) camp than other distance trails like the AT and PCT. Fortunately, I recorded where I slept every night, so I was able to go back through and see if this perception matched my reality.

Turns out, I camped or stayed somewhere for free almost 2 out of every 3 nights. Note that I categorized nights spent in the huts as “free nights,” though I technically paid for this when I bought a hut pass at the beginning. I decided to categorize huts as “free” nights because I wasn’t paying out of pocket upon arrival, so I stayed at them liberally. As you’ll see below, the huts ended up being extremely economical.

Where did I sleep?
------------------
Perhaps an even more interesting breakdown is where I slept each night. In my 101 nights on trail, I spent:

    - 53 nights in my tent

    - 26 nights in huts

    - 18 nights in hostels, hotels, or rented cabins

    - 4 nights in the homes of trail angels

Here’s a chart showing the percentage of nights slept in each type of accommodation:

.. raw:: html

The big takeaway here is how many huts there are on the South Island. I slept in the huts a little less than half of my time on the South Island, which is probably pretty average. I know two guys who slept in huts or hostels all but two nights!

How much did it cost per night to stay in the huts?
---------------------------------------------------
Given that I spent 26 nights in the huts, **it cost me $3.27 USD/night to stay in the huts**. This was slightly better value than buying individual hut tickets, but only by a few cents. It would have been more affordable had I bought the 6-month hut pass instead of the 12-month, which is what I would recommend future thru-hikers do.

Total Cost
==========
Before I get into the breakdown of my total expenses for Te Araroa, I want to note that my thru-hike of the Te Araroa took less than the average of 4-5 months. Because my hike was relatively quick, I had to buy less days of food, and readers should take my numbers as something of a lower limit. Budget liberally. I think a thru-hike could certainly be done cheaper, but the average hiker almost certainly spends more.

In evaluating cost, it’s also important to note that my **numbers do not include initial gear purchases or plane tickets**. I had most of my gear already intact after the PCT, so I did not need to assemble a kit for Te Araroa. I did include the cost of shoes, which I bought ahead of time, as well as any gear I purchased along the way (e.g., replacement socks). I did not include flight expenses, because they vary significantly by geography. The information below is best interpreted as how much Te Araroa cost **while I was on the trail**.

How much did it cost?
---------------------
My total cost was $3,085.98 USD, or $30.55/day.

Remember, that number doesn’t include original gear purchases or any flights. I was surprised that my cost per day was over $30 USD—it didn’t feel like that while hiking.

What did you spend your money on?
---------------------------------
I opened a travel credit card specifically for this trip, so I had detailed records for most of my spending. Unfortunately, there was $466.74 in cash spending that I cannot categorize with any certainty. Most of this money probably went toward additional town meals or lodging, as I occasionally split a hotel room or large meal with fellow hikers and paid them back in cash. Regardless, the $2,619.24 that I do have records for give a pretty good breakdown of where I spent my money:

Also, some fun facts:

    - 34%, or one out of every three days on the North Island I went to a Subway, Pizza Hut, or McDonalds. In total, I made 6 trips to Subway, 7 to Pizza Hut, and 7 to McDonalds. By comparison, I only stopped at one McDonalds on the South Island. I assure you that this was the result of availability, not an improvement in diet.

    - In total, it cost me $42.35 USD to mail my bounce box along the trail. I ended up mailing it to 5 stops along the way (Kerikeri, Auckland, Wellington, Wanaka, and Queenstown).

    - I paid $150.17 USD for my Whanganui canoe rental. I was fortunate to go with a group of thru-hikers, or else this cost would have been much higher.

    - My most expensive resupply was $111.44 USD (Havelock).

    - The “Other” is primarily the cost of going to see *Star Wars: Rogue One* in theaters…twice.


Conclusion
==========
All things considered, my hike ended up costing about $1.65/mi. If you add in the initial gear costs and plane tickets to and from New Zealand, my entire trip probably cost something approaching $3/mi. If anyone planning their hike has additional questions or wants more information, feel free to contact me. For now, I’ll answer one last question:

Was my experience worth it?
---------------------------
Absolutely.
